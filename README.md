Photo Management for Professionals
ShutterBug is an HTML/Java/MySQL application originally created for the professional photo studio in Melbourne Australia, FundFoto. Photographers travel to local schools, set up a portrait studio, and execute a 'shoot' for all the students in each class. Parents are then presented with proofs of all the shots as well as one selected finished portrait to review. The parents may choose to keep only the selected portrait, or may order additional prints of it or any of the other proofs. The prints are presented in a number of sizes and can also be prepared in various framed formats. As there is no obligation to purchase anything and the sitting is not charged for, this provides a low pressure selling process where parents with no previous professional photographic experience can appreciate the value of a proper photo shot in capturing candid images of their children and can have control over which shots are eventually taken home.
